## 🧠 Concept

This project was created with the help of **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**.  
I described my idea, and ChatGPT helped me bring it to life — from encryption logic using emojis to responsive UI design with dark mode.

### 💬 Original Prompt:

    I want to build a project using JavaScript.  
	There will be two options: Encrypt and Decrypt.  
	Encrypt will have two inputs: message and password, and output 	a string of emojis.  
	Decrypt will take emojis and password, and give back the original message.
